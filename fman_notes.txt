this is where I will make a template file that will help beginners create
their file and folder structure. It will create the files natively inside
of termux and then with a separate command copy and paste the files into
the Pydroid3 native directory. this will make it easier to use Pydroid3 as an
editor given that it's easier on the eyes and also so you can run the native
terminal because it cannot run files that reside outside of it's own directory
